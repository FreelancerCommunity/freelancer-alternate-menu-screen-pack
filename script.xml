A Pack of Alternate Menu Screens By Ruppetthemuppet

Contains:
Dom'Kavosh Ruins: The Remains of a Dom'Kavosh Stronghold Abandoned Long Ago... But Wait! Is That Gate Still Active?
Far Moon: Only Dust and Echos Remain in this Area of Space as Twin Gas Giants Orbit Each Other Slowly and Mournfully.
Guardian of Seto: Recent Blood Dragon Attacks on Planet Junyo and Surrounding Trade Lanes has Forced the Kusari Authorities to 
Repostion Battleship Myoko Above Seto... Who Knows when they will Next Attack?

This Set of Screens Was Packaged with 'Cold' Space Scenes In mind a 'Hot' Pack with More Action, and Different Colors can be Downloaded on Lancer's Reactor.
Ok, I'd rather you Didn't use This in Your mod Without Asking... If you really can't be bothered to make your own THN Script, 
then Email me At: Ruppetthemuppet@hotmail.co.uk and I'll Grant you Permission to use these. If you ask Really Nicely, then
I Might make a Custom one for you...
Another Note: This has No Effect on Ingame Files, so if you Prefer My Screens to the Normal Ones, then you can Leave this Mod active
and play on vanilla Server.
Enjoy!

Ruppet.
