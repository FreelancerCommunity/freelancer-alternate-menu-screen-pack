A set of basic alternate menu screens for Freelancer. Please feel free to use these in your mod with credit, or use them as the basis for your own custom menu screens!

Contains:

Dom'Kavosh Ruins: The remains of a Dom'Kavosh stronghold abandoned long ago.
Far Moon: Only dust and echoes remain in this area of space as twin gas giants orbit each other slowly and mournfully.
Guardian of Seto: Recent Blood Dragon attacks on planet Junyo and surrounding trade lanes have forced the Kusari Authorities to re-position Battleship Myoko above Seto. Who knows when they will next attack?

Note: This addon has no effect on gameplay-related files, so if you prefer these screens to the vanilla ones, then you can leave this mod active and play on vanilla multiplayer server with no compatibility issues.

These files have been cleaned up and commented. Please feel free to use them in your own mod with credit, or as the basis for your own menu screens!
